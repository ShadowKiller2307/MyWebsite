            In this Clicker Game you play as a Software-developer. Your goal is to gain Money by writing code and then
            sell it in products.<br>
            First your Programs will be quite short.<br>
            5 lines each to be precise...<br>
            You won't earn much and it will be necessary to sell many products but over time you will upgrade the
            program you are working with which leads to high-quality-Code<br>
